Some thoughts about how this is going to work:

Size of Pizza: Small, Medium, Large.
Small pizzas will start at 8.00 and will be 10 inches across
Medium Pizzas will start at 12.00 and will be 14 inches across
Large Pizzas will start at 14.00 and will be 16 inches across

Toppings will be divided into Meat and Non-Meat.

to add a non meat topping on a small it will cost $.50
to add a non meat topping on a medium it will cost $.70
to add a non meat topping on a large it will cost $1.00

to add a meat topping on a small it will cost $1.00
to add a meat topping on a medium it will cost $1.40
to add a meat topping on a large it will cost $2.00

Looking to use the drop down choose between pizza sizing and pricing
also appending another drop down menu when users want to add another
topping.

meat toppings In Order: Anchovy, Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Chicken, Ham, Lingui√ßa, Meatball,  Pepperoni, Salami, Sausage

non-meat Toppings In Order: None, Basil, Bell Pepper, Extra Cheese, Garlic, Jalapeno, Mushroom, Olive, Onion, Pineapple, Fresh Tomato, Sundried Tomato


Thoughts: Once each topping is collected, push the value into an array and when calculating price it'll be easy just to count the number of items in an array. As Meat and NonMeat have different prices.
