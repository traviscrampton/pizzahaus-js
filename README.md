also appending another drop down menu when users want to add another
topping.

meat toppings In Order: Anchovy, Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Chicken, Ham, Lingui√ßa, Meatball,  Pepperoni, Salami, Sausage

non-meat Toppings In Order: None, Basil, Bell Pepper, Extra Cheese, Garlic, Jalapeno, Mushroom, Olive, Onion, Pineapple, Fresh Tomato, Sundried Tomato


Thoughts: Once each topping is collected, push the value into an array and when calculating price it'll be easy just to count the number of items in an array. As Meat and NonMeat have different prices.
